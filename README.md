This project show the list of Users of Github using [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) Apis and show **details** of each user.

The apk version of the application is available through [this link](https://github.com/miladisaei/GithubUsers/blob/master/GithubUsers.apk)

> **Notice:** To use this source code, you must first get your access token through your user panel in GitHub and place it in the APP_TOKEN

# technologies

Below is a list of features I used:

1.  **Kotlin:** Kotlin is a statically-typed, cross-platform language with functional and object-oriented features for efficient and expressive app development.

2. **MVVM + CLEAN Architecture:** MVVM and Clean Architecture enhance app scalability, maintainability, and testability through user-centered modular design and separation of concerns.

3. **Jetpack Compose:** Jetpack Compose streamlines Android UI development with a modern, reactive, and intuitive toolkit.

4. **Jetpack Compose Navigation (Single activity, zero fragments):** Navigation Compose simplifies Android app navigation with a declarative and composable API.

5. **Kotlin Coroutines + Flow:** Coroutines and Flow are tools for asynchronous programming in Kotlin that provide a lightweight, efficient, and structured way of managing concurrency and handling sequential and parallel streams of data.

6. **Retrofit + OkHttp:** Retrofit simplifies HTTP calls on Android and Java with type-safety and automatic response parsing.

7. **Room:** Room is an Android library that simplifies SQLite database access with type-safety and automatic caching.

8. **Hilt Dependency Injection:** Hilt simplifies Android dependency management with Dagger and support for Android components.

9. **Unit Testing:** Unit Testing verifies software components work as intended with automated tests.

11. **Data Store:** Data Store simplifies data storage and retrieval on Android with a unified API and consistent behavior across devices.


# Architectures
![MVVM Clean Architecture](https://i.ibb.co/RzSR4nv/MVVM-Clean-Architecture.png)
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a design pattern used in mobile app development that separates the presentation layer from the business logic and data model. This pattern enables a clean separation of responsibilities and facilitates easier testing and maintenance of the code. MVVM is commonly used with the Clean Architecture pattern, which is a modular approach to software design that emphasizes separation of concerns and promotes testability, maintainability, and scalability.
